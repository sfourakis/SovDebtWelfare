#This file contains a library of functions for solving the model of government default with long term debt described in Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012).

#By: Stelios Fourakis

#The code implementing Tauchen's method for approximating an AR(1) process via a Markov Chain is largely
#taken from https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl/blob/master/src/markov/markov_approx.jl
#The remainder is my own.
#I have tried to name objects, variables, and functions descriptively, so that their contents and/or purpose can be deduced immediately.
#I have also tried to use the following convention in for loops, especially in nested ones:
#1. i iterates over values of the income process
#2. j iterates over values of current period borrowing
#3. jj iterates over either values of next period borrowing or entries in the government policy functions for next period borrowing
#Except where otherwise noted, the first dimension of an array corresponds to the asset state and the second to the income process state

#Throughout, we use the convention that debt is an asset, so negative amounts indicate net liabilities.

#The code relies largely on a set of parametrically typed immutable objects which are defined at the beginning of the code. These types are:
#1. ar1Params - includes the specification of an AR(1) process as well as the range and resolution of the Markov chain to be used to approximate it
#2. iidParams - includes the specification of an iid process
#3. apSearchParams - includes the information necessary to implement a bisection style grid search which exploits the monotonicity of of the government's borrowing policy function
#4. longTermBondSpec - includes value of basic parameters of the model (beta, R, etc.), the specification of the income process, and the specification of the borrowing grid
#5. longTermBondEval - includes the income process, value function grids, policy function grids, the bond price function, and some other convenience parameters/grids


#Note that "immutable" in Julia does not mean that an object cannot be changed at all, but rather that none of its toplevel components can be set to a different value.
#For example, with an immutable x containing two arrays A1 and A2, x.A1=zeros(2,3) would throw an error, but x.A1[1]=0.0 would not.

#Many of the functions below mutate the contents of one or more of their arguments.

#5. stdSpan: the number of standard deviations to each side of the mean which should fall within the grid
#6. inflateEndPoints: a Boolean variable marking whether the probability of jumping to a point outside the grid should be assigned to the closest endpoint (true)
#or discarded (effectively reassigning it to the remaining points in proportion to their probability of being reached)

#policies is a parametrically typed immutable containing the government's policy functions. Its contents are:
#1. apLowM: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing the government's borrowing policy, conditional on repayment,
#when the m shock takes its lowest value.
#2. apHighM: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing the government's borrowing policy, conditional on repayment,
#when the m shock takes its highest value.

#3., 4., and 5.  are mListLength, mAPThreshold, apPolicy
#mListLength, mAPThreshold, and apPolicy fully describe the government's policy function conditional on repayment.

#6. and 7. are defThreshold, and firstRepayInd
#When the above mentioned three three are combined additionally with defThreshold and firstRepayInd, they completely describe the government's policies,
#except in two special cases described just below

#8. and 9. are alwaysDefault and neverDefault
#these arrays contain marker variables for whether we can take shortcuts during the steps involving integration over m.

#Specifically these objects are:

#3. mListLength: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing the number of distinct
#levels of asset which, conditional on repayment, the government might choose depending on the value of m. Since the rest of the government's
#policies conditional on repayment is stored in sparse matrices which are NOT zeroed at irrelevant values once the government's problem is
#solved again, we have to keep track of exactly how many cells are actually in use

#4. mAPThreshold: a one dimensional array (axes are 1. current persistent income) containing two dimensional sparse matrices.
#Each of these matrices is square NxN with N equal to the number of borrowing points (so that each column can potentially hold the longest
#possible policy function). For each of these matrices, the second axis is current asset level. Given a specific matrix and column, each cell
#from row 1 to the row indicated by the corresponding entry of mListLength indicates the upper bound of the values of m for which the government,
#conditional on repayment, chooses the borrowing policy specified in apPolicy.

#5. apPolicy: a one dimensional array (axes are 1. current persistent income) containing two dimensional sparse matrices.
#The layout of each is exactly as for those in mAPThreshold. Given the matrix for persistent income level i and column for asset level j,
#the entries of apPolicy[i][:,j] in rows 1 to the value of mListLength[j,i] indicate the policy choices associated with the thresholds in mAPThreshold.

#Combining these three allows us to say that, when persistent income level i and current asset level j, conditional on repayment,
#for m between it minimum value and the mAPThreshold[i][1,j], the government chooses apPolicy[i][1,j], and if mListLength[j,i] is strictly greater than 1,
#then it chooses apPolicy[i][jj,j] for m in between mAPThreshold[i][jj-1,j] and mAPThreshold[i][jj,j] for jj between 2 and mListLength[j,i], inclusive.

#6. defThreshold: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing the levels of m below
#which default occurs.

#7. firstRepayInd: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing the first indices of mAPThreshold,
#apPolicy, and apProbability which is relevant for integrating the government's value function over realizations of m.

#8. alwaysDefault: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing Boolean variables indicating
#whether the government always defaults at each persistent income and asset state.

#9. neverDefault: a two dimensional array (axes are 1. current asset level and 2. current persistent income) containing Boolean variables indicating
#whether the government never defaults at each persistent income and asset state.
